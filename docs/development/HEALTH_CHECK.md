# Project Health Check: togo

**Date:** 2025-09-27

## 1. Build & Test Status
- `cargo check`: **Success**
- `cargo test`: **All tests passed** (423 unit tests, 89 doc-tests, 0 failures)
- `cargo doc`: **Documentation generated successfully**
- No build errors or warnings (except 1 minor rustdoc warning: unclosed HTML tag `Arc` in `src/arc.rs:1541`)

## 2. Code Quality & Linting
- **Clippy and Rust lints:**
	- `rust.unsafe_code = "forbid"` in Cargo.toml (no unsafe code in production)
	- Many Clippy lints set to `warn`, some to `deny`/`forbid` (good practice)
	- `#![allow(dead_code)]` in some modules (may indicate unused code)
	- `rust.missing_docs = "warn"` (encourages documentation)
- **Documentation coverage:**
	- High, but some warnings for missing docs may exist

## 3. Error Handling & Panics
- **Potential panics in production code:**
	- Use of `.unwrap()` and `.expect()` in several places (notably in `svg.rs`, `polyline.rs`, `algo/convex_hull.rs`)
	- These can panic at runtime if assumptions are violated (e.g., empty vectors, file creation failures)
	- No direct `panic!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!`, or `unreachable!` in production code (only in comments/tests)
- **Suggestions:**
	- Replace `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` in library code with proper error handling (return `Result` or propagate errors)
	- Audit all `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` for safety in all public APIs

## 4. Unsafe Code
- No unsafe code in production (enforced by lint)
- One function in `utils.rs` is marked as unsafe for testing only (documented)

## 5. Concurrency & Soundness
- No use of threads, `Mutex`, `Arc`, or other concurrency primitives in main code
- No obvious soundness or memory safety issues detected

## 6. Structure & Modularity
- Project is well-structured: clear separation of modules (arc, point, polyline, algo, intersection, etc.)
- Good use of `pub`/`mod` for API surface
- Some modules have `#![allow(dead_code)]` (may want to review for unused code)

## 7. TODOs, FIXMEs, and Edge Cases
- Some `TODO` comments in intersection and algorithm modules (e.g., `int_segment_segment.rs`, `int_line_arc.rs`)
- Some edge cases noted in comments (e.g., infinite loops, degenerate cases)
- No `FIXME` or `HACK` found in code
- Some test assertions use `assert!(false)` as a catch-all (could be improved)

## 8. API & Usability
- Public API is clear and well-documented
- Some functions return `Option` or may panic if misused (documented)
- No major API design issues detected

## 9. Production Readiness: **Good, but not perfect**
- **Strengths:**
	- Passes all tests, builds cleanly, well-structured, well-documented, no unsafe code
	- Linting and Clippy configuration is strong
- **Risks:**
	- Use of `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` in library code can cause panics in production
	- Some TODOs and edge cases are not fully handled
	- Some dead code and missing documentation
- **Recommendation:**
	- Audit and refactor `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` in all public-facing code
	- Address TODOs and edge cases where possible
	- Review and remove dead code
	- Consider increasing documentation coverage

---

**Overall:**
- The project is in **good health and is close to production-ready** for most use cases.
- For critical production use, a final audit for panics, error handling, and documentation is recommended.
