// #00015
/// Computes the distance between a point and a circle.
///
/// This function finds the shortest distance from a point to a circle,
/// along with the closest point on the circle.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `p` - The point to measure distance from
/// * `circle` - The circle to measure distance to
///
/// # Returns
/// A tuple containing:
/// * The minimum distance as a f64
/// * The closest point on the circle
/// * A boolean indicating if the point is at the center of the circle
///
/// # Algorithm
/// The algorithm:
/// 1. Compute the vector from the circle center to the point
/// 2. If the point is not at the center, normalize this vector and scale it by the circle radius
/// 3. Compute the distance as the absolute difference between the point's distance from the center
///    and the circle radius
/// 4. Return the closest point on the circle as the center plus the scaled vector
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// use togo::prelude::*;
/// let c = circle(point(1.0, 1.0), 1.0);
/// let p = point(3.0, 1.0);
/// let (dist, closest, equidistant) = dist_point_circle(&p, &c);
/// // dist = 1.0, closest = (2.0, 1.0), equidistant = false
/// ```
